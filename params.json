Now, depending on how stressed those CPUs are, Master Tux will feel healthy or not.\r\nSee, `dmesg` for more information.\r\n\r\n## Awesome! Let's run it in production\r\n\r\nYeah! Great idea! Just, don't tell anyone ...\r\n\r\n![don't do it](https://media.giphy.com/media/SEp6Zq6ZkzUNW/giphy.gif)\r\n\r\n## What's next?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Implement as audio device\r\n- [ ] Improve sound samples\r\n- [ ] Cleanup code smells\r\n- [ ] A debian package would be awesome\r\n- [ ] Generate sound waves instead of having hardcoded data\r\n- [ ] Automated tests?!\r\n",
